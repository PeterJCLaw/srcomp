History
=======

SRComp was created for `Student Robotics <https://studentrobotics.org>`__' 2014
competition, and has been used for all subsequent competitions. It has also been
used for a number of other similar, though usually smaller, events.

SRComp continues to evolve to support the needs of Student Robotics competitions.
